## Business Insights

- Government is the most profitable segment
- Q2 and Q4 show peak performance (seasonal trend)
- Germany and Mexico show consistent YoY growth
- Government segment has volatile margins
- Limited discounting — opportunity for targeted pricing strategy

---

## Recommendations

- Scale midmarket sales operations
- Launch campaigns ahead of Q2/Q4 peaks
- Reassess strategy in France and volatile regions
- Introduce A/B tested discount offers in slow-performing areas

---

## Limitations & Next Steps

- No operational cost data (limits full net margin analysis)
- Dataset limited to 2013–2014
- No customer-level insights
- Next phase: add forecasting, operational data, and expand time horizon
